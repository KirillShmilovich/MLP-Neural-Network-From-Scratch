# Building a multilayer perceptron from scrath

The mathematics and computation that drive neural networks are frequently seen as erudite and impenetrable. A clearly illustrated example of building from scratch a neural network for handwriting recognition is presented in `MLP.ipynb`. This tutorial provides a step-by-step overview of the mathematics and code used in many modern machine learning algorithms.

## Installation 

To view this notebook in your browser simply click the `MLP.ipynb` file above.
